# packages
Artix system and world packages

### Maintainers

The packages git follows the archlinux svn structure.
It contains both core and extra PKGBUILD

Each package folder consists of a trunk and repos directory
The package will always be updated in trunk, and then based on trunk action taken in the repos directory.

    testingpkg -p foo2 -s staging -u

release package 'foo3' from trunk to repos/community-x86_64 and push

##### The jenkins pipeline will not trigger any action on the server, if only trunk has been modified, commited and pushed.

* Jenkinsfile stages
    * Checkout
    * Build
    * Add
    * Remove

* Any repo moving operation of a package in git will trigger Add and Remove stages.
* Any new repos subdirectory will trigger the Build stage.
* The trunk dir will only trigger a checkout, modifications won't be built.

### Contributors

If you want a new or updated package merged into the git repository, please send a Pull Request with only the trunk of a given package. Please do not send PRs containing repos/$repo folders.
